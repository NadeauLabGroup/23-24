## Nadeau Group: Installing plugins to use with Fiji

1. Download/pull the `.class` files corresponding to the desired plugin.

2. Drag and drop one or all files into Fiji's GUI

/>
    - If the class files have been installed previously, select "Replace". Note this will have to be done for each .class file that was imported.

3. Close and restart Fiji to load the imported plugins

4. Plugins should now be ready to run and located in the dropdown menu under **Plugins**
    - In this example I imported `MHI Script` and `Track ing` which are now located here.
